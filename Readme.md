Japanese learning site

i made this site because i needed a place to store my new learnt words when my notebook ran out
i also made a quiz feature that will help me test my self and get better 
i can search easily for words

i used node.js - express and angular to practice those technologies

install and run:
front:
npm install
ng serve

back:
npm install
nodemon server.js
